# Notes on 7/23/2023

I have added form and hero section:

- Hero section is a simple section with a title, subtitle and a button. You can use it as a landing page or as a section in your website. it has 4 different styles, you can check them out in the HeroSection.tsx file. default, image on the right, bg image and hero with form

- Form is very simple, made with zod and react-hook-form. You can use it to get user input and send it to your backend. You can find the form in the components folder. It has 1 style so far, you can check it out in the Form.tsx file. default and with image. I have added backend with nodemailer as well, if you want to use it you have to create a .env file and add your email and password.I am using google smtp but you choose your provider. I would probably add more styles in the future.

I am pushing everything that i have added right now, some of the components, such as alert and According not functioning properly.
